## Release Goal: 

- Sprint 1: Get used to new technologies such as React, MySQL, Flask, as well as involve user stories where the user can have an access to the general interface of the app, such as Home page and static pages.
- Sprint 2: Involve user stories where users of any type can create an account and manage their accounts / profiles, along with allowing users to book appointments and see appointments history. 
- Sprint 3: Involve user stories where customers and service providers have more in-depth functionalities, such as the chat feature, writing posts, ratings, and reviews. 
- Sprint 4: Build a fully functional, user friendly, and responsive desktop web application that allows customers to book and purchase beauty services from service providers and for service providers to sell their services. All key features are implemented with little to no bugs.
