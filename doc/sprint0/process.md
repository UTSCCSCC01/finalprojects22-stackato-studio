# Stackato Studio
## Process Document


### How did you organize the team? 
The Stackato Studio team was organized and combined through the process of friends and acquaintances.

### Which tools did you use, if any? 
Discord is our primary method of communication. The team was initially formed as a group on Discord followed by a full in-person meeting an hour before the lecture.

### How did you make decisions?
Points or concerns are raised by an individual after which there is a vote. Since there are 7 of us in our team, 4 votes result in a decision.

### How did you define priority and/or points of user stories?
Each member votes on the priority of a user story. The story that gets the most or at least 4 votes gets the most priority.

### How many rounds of voting (on average) did you need to come to a consensus for the point estimate?
On average around 1 round of voting was enough
 
### How frequently did you meet? 
We have met almost everyday so far in a mixture of online and in-person meetings. Moving forward, the meetings will be decreased to 3 per week but increased if necessary 

### What lessons should you take forward to the next phase?

- Having less meetings and arranging emergency meetings spontaneously when needed is more time-efficient than having too many scheduled meetings 
- The ability to reach teammates when help/feedback is required is very valuable as it may save a lot of time for the developer and hence the team 
 will create the dillinger image and pull in the necessary dependencies.
