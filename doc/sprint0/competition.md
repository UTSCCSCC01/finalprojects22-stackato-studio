### Existing products that solve the same problem as yours
- Our competition are any offline stores providing beauty and physical labor services independently, such as salons, spas. 
- [TaskRabbit](https://www.taskrabbit.ca/ca/en/dashboard) is another one of our competition for the physical and residential services that _amorr_ will also provide, such as plumbing, cleaning. More specifically, [TaskRabbit](https://www.taskrabbit.ca/ca/en/dashboard) will become a bigger competition if they were to provide beauty services in the future.

### How is your product different?
- In the service providers' perspective, using _amorr_ as a primary or additional source of income will greatly eliminate the costs of rent and utilities that physical workplaces require. It is also a platform for individuals who are not signed in any physical stores and is looking for extra income to promote themselves using _amorr_.
- In the clients' perspective, booking a service through _amorr_ where service providers will come to the clients' door will eliminate time constraints, scheduling issues, transit costs, waiting in a queue, and thus bring more conveniency for the clients' side, as compared to clients going to the store physically.
- Currently [TaskRabbit](https://www.taskrabbit.ca/ca/en/dashboard) focuses on providing services on physical labour, while _amorr_ mainly focuses on providing beauty services, though there are some additions on physical labor and residential services as well.   

### Who are the users and/or what are the scenarios?
#### Key Users:
- People who seek additional comfort and convenience
- Elderly/disabled people who struggle to commute
- People who don't have the necessary skills to complete a household task (e.g. plumbing)
- Service provides looking to generate revenue

#### Key Use Cases/Usage Scenarios:
- Cathy has a lot of back pain this saturday morning, and she is also feeling very lazy and doesn't want to move a muscle. She heads on to the amorr website and books a massagist to come to her home and give her a massage.
- Marc has a clogged sink, but he has no idea how to fix it. He calls a contractor from amorr and gets it taken care of within two hours.
- Anna is a 24 year old student who is very skilled at installing kitchen backsplashes. She is currently studying and would like to have extra income. She creates a service provider profile on amorr and declares that she does backsplash installation. She then starts getting customers, and travels to their homes to install backsplashes. She makes a lot of money in doing so!
- Robert is a senior who struggles to drive long distances. He wants to have a picnic with his children who live far away, and he also needs to haul his barbecue. Thankfully, he can head on the amorr app and schedule someone with a van to drive him and his equipment there.

### Why do you think the competitors didnâ€™t focus on these users and/or scenarios? And, what would it take from them to do so?
- Perhaps each of them still want to focus more on enhancing their services with respect to their sectors, like TaskRabbit with their main focus on physical labor services, and how offline services already have their physical stores setup and would prefer clients to come to the stores rather than them coming to the clients.
- It is more likely that big companies like _TaskRabbit_, _IKEA_, and _Uber_ will buy _amorr_ in the future, rather than compete. This could be an exit strategy of _amorr_.
