## New User Stories from unfinished Sprint 2 Tasks
- As a User, I want to be able to set and update a profile picture for my account so future customers/service providers can recognize me easier during the day of the appointment

## What are practices that you should continue during next sprint
- Frequent Sprint meetings 
- Peer Review System through discord text channel
- Having a predetermined soft deadline for tasks before the sprint deadline
- Communicating progress over discord text channels and calls
- Starting standup meetings by sharing respective Jira Boards and tasks
- Having a meeting on the last day of the sprint dedicated to checking submissions and completion of tasks
- Implement limit of 1 task when volunteering to do tasks
- Utilizing React libraries frequently to cut down time spent

## What are some new practices that you might want to use during next sprint 
- Utilize React libraries even more to the point we will accept design changes to the initial figma design
- Increase frequency of Sprint meetings to ensure each member is making progress in their work
- A single person (the scrum master: Efkan) to lead the demo with the TA and the rest of us will be on standby to answer specific inquiries

# What are (if any) harmful practices you should stop using during next sprint 
- Drastic changes to the ER diagram of the mySQL database
- Last minute scrambling of tasks which can be prevented by spreading the work load more evenly throughout the week
- Each member taking turns presenting in the demo which ended up taking too much time (>20 minutes)

## Best Experiences of Sprint 2:
- Succesfully sending the first request from the frontend to the backend and receiving a 200 response
- Learning how to set up a file system to store user profile photos

## Worst Experiences of Sprint 2:
- Merging the branches last minute
- Last minute fixing of bugs and completion of tasks
